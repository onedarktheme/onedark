    Onedark
</h3>

Onedark is an open-source theme inspired by the iconic [Atom One Dark UI](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-ui) theme and the Neovim port [OneDark.nvim](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim). This theme is moody without sacrificing its colorful aspect, making it perfect to style a terminal, editor, or any other application!

### ðŸ§  Design Philosophy

- **Comfortable Dark Base with Layered Shades:** uses a range of subtle dark tones to create depth and reduce eye strain during extended use.
- **Intentional Color Differentiation:** employs colors to establish visual hierarchy and guide the userâ€™s attention effectively.
- **Balanced Contrast and Muted Tones:** avoids harsh colors and ensures smooth contrast for comfortable readability.

### ðŸŽ¨ Palette

Onedark offers 4 distinct palettes, which we call grim tones, each with its own mood and personality. These have been selected from the original 7 palettes found in Atom's One Dark theme. We reduced the set to focus on the most distinct ones and make maintenance easier. Whether you want to apply it to your terminal, code editor, or other apps, these palettes will bring a cohesive dark and stylish vibe.
